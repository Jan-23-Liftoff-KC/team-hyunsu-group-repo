# Project Outline
=======
### Overview
Health eHub application is intended to fill a noticeable gap in medical information.  While there are many provider-centric portal applications in health care, only one patient-based application from 10 years ago could be located. Multiple groups have the potential to benefit from this app:
* Large communities that have multiple proprietary provider portals and benefit from having a single point of data,
* Smaller communities that do not have as many digitized applications, and
* Travelers or digital nomads could benefit from an electronic single source of information.

The intended use for Health eHub is not to compete with provider portals but enhance opportunities by driving patient engagement using this application as a tool to store medical data.
